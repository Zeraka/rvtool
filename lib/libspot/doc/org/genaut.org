#+DESCRIPTION: Spot command-line tool that generates ω-automata from known patterns
#+INCLUDE: setup.org
#+HTML_LINK_UP: tools.html
#+PROPERTY: header-args:sh :results verbatim :exports both

This tool outputs ω-automata generated from scalable patterns.

These patterns are usually taken from the literature (see the
[[./man/genaut.1.html][=genaut=]](1) man page for references).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports results
genaut --help | sed -n '/Pattern selection:/,/^$/p' | sed '1d;$d'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
      --ks-nca=RANGE         A co-Büchi automaton with 2N+1 states for which
                             any equivalent deterministic co-Büchi automaton
                             has at least 2^N/(2N+1) states.
      --l-dsa=RANGE          A deterministic Streett automaton with 4N states
                             with no equivalent deterministic Rabin automaton
                             of less than N! states.
      --l-nba=RANGE          A Büchi automaton with 3N+1 states whose
                             complementary Streett automaton needs at least N!
                             states.
      --m-nba=RANGE          An NBA with N+1 states whose determinization needs
                             at least N! states
#+end_example


By default, the output format is [[file:hoa.org][HOA]], but this can be controlled using
[[file:oaut.org][the common output options for automata.]]

For instance:
#+NAME: kscobuchi2
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
genaut --ks-nca=2 --dot
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file kscobuchi2.svg :var txt=kscobuchi2 :exports results
  $txt
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:kscobuchi2.svg]]

The patterns can be specified using a range of the form =N= (a single
value), =N..M= (all values between N and M included), or =..M= (all
values between 1 and M included).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim :exports both
genaut --ks-nca=..5 --stats='%F=%L has %s states'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ks-nca=1 has 3 states
: ks-nca=2 has 5 states
: ks-nca=3 has 7 states
: ks-nca=4 has 9 states
: ks-nca=5 has 11 states
