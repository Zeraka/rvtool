  /// \brief Encode and print an automaton as an AIGER circuit.
  ///
  /// The circuit actually encodes the transition relation of the automaton, not
  /// its acceptance condition. Therefore, this function will reject automata
  /// whose acceptance condition is not trivial (i.e. true).
  /// States are encoded by latches (or registers) in the circuit. Atomic
  /// propositions are encoded as inputs and outputs of the circuit. To know
  /// which AP should be encoded as outputs, print_aiger() relies on the named
  /// property "synthesis-outputs", which is a bdd containing the conjunction of
  /// such output propositions. All other AP are encoded as inputs. If the named
  /// property is not set, all AP are encoded as inputs, and the circuit has no
  /// output.
  ///
  /// \param os           The output stream to print on.
  /// \param aut          The automaton to output.
