#+TITLE: Command-line tools installed by Spot {{{SPOTVERSION}}}
#+DESCRIPTION: List of all the command-line tools installed by Spot {{{SPOTVERSION}}}
#+INCLUDE: setup.org
#+HTML_LINK_UP: index.html
#+PROPERTY: header-args:sh :results verbatim :exports both

This document introduces command-line tools that are installed with
the Spot library.  We give some examples to highlight possible
use-cases but shall not attempt to cover all features exhaustively
(please check the man pages for further inspiration).

* Conventions

For technical reasons related to the way we generate these pages, we
use the following convention when rendering shell commands.  The
commands issued to the shell are formatted like this with a cyan line
on the left:

#+NAME: helloworld
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo Hello World
#+END_SRC

And the output of such a command is formatted as follows, with a
magenta line on the left:

#+RESULTS: helloworld
: Hello World

Parts of these documents (e.g., lists of options) are actually the
results of shell commands and will be presented as above, even if the
corresponding commands are hidden.

* Documentation common to multiple tools

- [[file:ioltl.org][common input and output options for LTL/PSL formulas]]
- [[file:oaut.org][common output options for automata]]
- [[file:hoa.org][input and output support for the HOA format]]

* Command-line tools

  formula.
- [[file:ltldo.org][=ltldo=]] Run LTL/PSL formulas through other tools using common [[file:ioltl.org][input]]
  and [[file:oaut.org][output]] interfaces.
- [[file:ltlsynt.org][=ltlsynt=]] Synthesize AIGER circuits from LTL/PSL specifications.

- [[file:autfilt.org][=autfilt=]] Filter, convert, and transform \omega-automata.
- [[file:autcross.org][=autcross=]] Cross-compare tools that process automata.

* Man pages

In addition to the above illustrated documentation, Spot also installs
man pages for all these tools.  These man pages are mostly generated
automatically from the =--help= output of each tool, and often
completed with additional text (like examples or bibliography).  For
convenience, you can browse their HTML versions:

[[./man/autcross.1.html][=autcross=]](1),
[[./man/autfilt.1.html][=autfilt=]](1),
[[./man/dstar2tgba.1.html][=dstar2tgba=]](1),

[[./man/spot.7.html][=spot=]](7).

* Advanced use-cases

- [[file:csv.org][Reading and writing CSV files]]
- [[file:satmin.org][SAT-based minimization of Deterministic ω-Automata]]
- [[file:hierarchy.org][Exploring the temporal hierarchy of Manna & Pnueli]]

* Citing

If some of these tools have played a significant role in a work that
lead to some academic publication, please consider citing Spot.  Our
[[file:citing.org][citing page]] has a list of papers you could cite.

Additionally, the man pages of these tools also contains additional
references about the algorithms or data sources used.

If you did some benchmark comparison against Spot, or if you built a
tool above features provided by Spot, please make it clear what
version of Spot you are using.  Spot is improved regularly, and
results might be different with another version.
