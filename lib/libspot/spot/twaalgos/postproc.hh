  /// \brief Wrap TGBA/BA/Monitor post-processing algorithms in an
  /// easy interface.
  ///
  /// This class is a shell around scc_filter(),
  /// minimize_obligation(), simulation(), iterated_simulations(),
  /// degeneralize(), to_generalized_buchi(), tgba_determinize(), and
  /// other algorithms.  These different algorithms will be combined
  /// depending on the various options set with set_type(),
  /// set_pref(), and set_level().
  ///
  /// This helps hiding some of the logic required to combine these
  /// simplifications efficiently (e.g., there is no point calling
  /// degeneralize() or any simulation when minimize_obligation()
  /// succeeded.)
  ///
  /// Use set_type() to select desired output type.
  ///
  /// Use the set_pref() method to specify whether you favor
  /// deterministic automata or small automata.  If you don't care,
  /// less post processing will be done.
  ///
  /// The set_level() method lets you set the optimization level.
  /// A higher level enables more costly post-processings.  For instance
  /// pref=Small,level=High will try two different post-processings
  /// (one with minimize_obligation(), and one with
  /// iterated_simulations()) an keep the smallest result.
  /// pref=Small,level=Medium will only try the iterated_simulations()
  /// when minimized_obligation failed to produce an automaton smaller
  /// than its input.  pref=Small,level=Low will only run
  /// simulation().
  ///
  /// The handling of alternating automata should change in the
  /// future, but currently \c Generic, \c Low, \c Any is the only
  /// configuration where alternation is preserved.  In any other
  /// configuration, \c remove_alternation() will be called.
