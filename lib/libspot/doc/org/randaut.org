#+TITLE: =randaut=
#+DESCRIPTION: Spot command-line tool for generating random ω-automata.
#+INCLUDE: setup.org
#+HTML_LINK_UP: tools.html
#+PROPERTY: header-args:sh :results verbatim :exports code

The =randaut= tool generates random (connected) automata.

By default, it will generate a random automaton with 10 states, no
acceptance sets, and using a set of atomic propositions you have to
supply.

#+NAME: randaut1

As for [[file:randltl.org][=randltl=]], you can supply a number of atomic propositions
instead of giving a list of atomic propositions.

* States and density

The numbers of states can be controlled using the =-Q= option.  This
option will accept a range as argument, so for instance =-Q3..6= will
generate an automaton with 3 to 6 states.

The number of edges can be controlled using the =-e= (or
=--density=) option.  The argument should be a number between 0 and 1.
In an automaton with $Q$ states and density $e$, the degree of each
state will follow a normal distribution with mean $1+(Q-1)d$ and
variance $(Q-1)e(1-e)$.

In particular =-e0= will cause all states to have 1 successors, and
=-e1= will cause all states to be interconnected.

* Acceptance condition

The generation of the acceptance sets abn is controlled with the following four parameters:

 - =-A ACCEPTANCE= (or =--acceptance=ACCEPTANCE=) controls both the acceptance condition,
   and the number of associated acceptance sets.  The =ACCEPTANCE= argument is documented
   in =--help= as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports results
randaut --help | sed -n '/^ \(ACCEPTANCE\|RANGE\)/,/^$/p'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 RANGE may have one of the following forms: 'INT', 'INT..INT', or '..INT'.
 In the latter case, the missing number is assumed to be 1.

 ACCEPTANCE may be either a RANGE (in which case generalized Büchi is
 assumed), or an arbitrary acceptance formula such as 'Fin(0)|Inf(1)&Fin(2)' in
 the same syntax as in the HOA format, or one of the following patterns:
   none
   all
   Buchi
   co-Buchi
   generalized-Buchi RANGE
   generalized-co-Buchi RANGE
   Rabin RANGE
   Streett RANGE
   generalized-Rabin INT RANGE RANGE ... RANGE
   parity (min|max|rand) (odd|even|rand) RANGE
   random RANGE
   random RANGE PROBABILITY
 The random acceptance condition uses each set only once, unless a probability
 (to reuse the set again every time it is used) is given.

#+end_example

 When a range of the form $i..j$ is used, the actual value is taken as randomly
 between $i$ and $j$ (included).

 - =-a= (or =--acc-probability=) controls the probability that any
   transition belong to a given acceptance set.
 - =-S= (or =--state-based-acceptance=) requests that the automaton
   use state-based acceptance.  In this case, =-a= is the probability
   that a /state/ belong to the acceptance set.  (Because Spot only
   deals with transition-based acceptance internally, this options
   force all transitions leaving a state to belong to the same
   acceptance sets.  But if the output format allows state-based
   acceptance, it will be used.)
 - =--colored= requests that each transition (of state if combined with =-S=)
   in the generated automaton should belong to exactly one set (in that
   case =-a= is ignored, and =-A= must be used to specify an acceptance
   condition with at least one set).

In addition, =-B= (or =--ba=) is a shorthand for =-A1 -S=,
ans =-s= (or =--spin=) implies =-B=.

For generating random parity automata you should use the option
=--colored= to make sure each transition (or state in the following
example) belong to exactly one acceptance set.  Note that you can
specify a precise parity acceptance such as =parity min even 3=, or
give =randaut= some freedom, as in this example.

#+NAME: randaut5c
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
randaut -Q10 -S --colored -A 'parity rand rand 3..4' 2 --dot

$txt
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

* Determinism

The output can only contain a single edge between two given states.
By default, the label of this edge is a random assignment of all
atomic propositions.  Two edges leaving the same state may therefore
have the same label.

If the =-D= (or =--deterministic=) option is supplied, the labels
are generated differently: once the degree $m$ of a state has been
decided, the algorithm will compute a set of $m$ disjoint
Boolean formulas over the given atomic propositions, such that the
sum of all these formulas is $\top$.  The resulting automaton is
therefore deterministic and complete.

#+NAME: randaut6
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
randaut -D -Q3 -e0.6 -A2 -a0.5 2 --dot
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file randaut6.svg :var txt=randaut6 :exports results
$txt
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
[[file:randaut6.svg]]


Note that in a deterministic automaton with $a$ atomic propositions,
it is not possible to have states with more than $2^a$ successors.  If
the combination of =-e= and =-Q= allows the situation where a state
can have more than $2^a$ successors, the degree will be clipped to
$2^a$.  When working with random deterministic automata over $a$
atomic propositions, we suggest you always request more than $2^a$
states.

* Output formats

The output format can be controlled using [[file:oaut.org][the common output options]]
like =--hoaf=, =--dot==, =--lbtt=, and =--spin=.  Note that =--spin=
automatically implies =--ba=.

Automata are send to standard output by default, by you can use =-o=
to give a filename, or even a pattern for filenames.  For instance the
following generates 20 automatas, but store them in different files
according to the acceptance condition.  The format =%g= represent the
formula for the acceptance condition and would not make a nice
filename, but =%[s]g= is a short name for that acceptance condition
(its is replaced by "other" if Spot does not know better).  We use
=-Hl= to output one automaton per line, so that =wc -l= will count
automata.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both

* Generating a stream of automata

Use option =-n= to specify a number of automata to build.  A negative
value will cause an infinite number of automata to be produced.  This
generation of multiple automata is useful when piped to another tool
that can process automata in batches.

Here is an example were we use [[file:autfilt.org][=autfilt=]] to scan an infinite stream
(=-n -1=) of random parity automata for the first automaton (=-n 1=)
that have exactly 5 SCCs of particular natures: we want 1 trivial SCC
(i.e. an SCC with no cycle), 1 rejecting SCC (an SCC without any
accepting SCCs), 2 inherently weak SCCs (SCCs contains only rejecting
cycles) among which one should be weak (all transitions should belong
to the same sets).  This leaves us with one extra SCC that should
necessarily mix accepting and rejecting cycles.

(Note: the '=.=' argument passed to =--dot= below hides default
options discussed [[file:oaut.org::#default-dot][on another page]], while '=s=' causes SCCs to be
displayed.)

#+NAME: randaut7
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
randaut -n -1 --colored -A'parity min odd 4' a b |
autfilt --sccs=5 --trivial-sccs=1 --rejecting-sccs=1 \
        --inherently-weak-sccs=2 --weak-sccs=1 -n 1 --dot=.s
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file randaut7.svg :var txt=randaut7 :exports results

#+END_SRC

You should be able to find each of the expected type of SCCs in the above picture.
The green rectangles mark the three SCCs that contain some accepting cycles.
