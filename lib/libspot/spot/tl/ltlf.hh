  /// \brief Convert an LTLf into an LTL formula.
  ///
  /// This is based on De Giacomo & Vardi (IJCAI'13) reduction from
  /// LTLf (finite-LTL) to LTL.
  ///
  /// In this reduction, finite words are extended into infinite words
  /// in which a new atomic proposition <code>alive</code> marks the
  /// prefix of the infinite word that corresponds to the original
  /// finite word.  The formula is rewritten to ensure that the
  /// eventualities occur during the "alive" portion.  For instance
  /// <code>a U b</code> becomes
  /// <code>alive&(a U (b & alive))&(alive U G!alive)</code>.
  ///
  /// The \a alive argument can be used to change the name of the
  /// atomic property used to introduce.  Additionally if \a alive is
  /// a string starting with and exclamation mark, e.g.,
  /// <code>!dead</code> then the atomic property will be built from
  /// the rest of the string, and its negation will be used in the
  /// transformation.  Using <code>!dead</code> rather than
  /// <code>alive</code> makes more sense if the state-space
  /// introduces a <code>dead</code> property on states representing
  /// the end of finite computations.
