=========================================================
executing heap operation "void *C::operator new(<<<replaced>>>)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void C::operator delete(void *)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void *operator new(<<<replaced>>>)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void operator delete(void *)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void *operator new[](<<<replaced>>>)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void operator delete[](void *)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void *operator new(<<<replaced>>>)"
  tjp->that() is 0 (should be 0)
executing heap operation "void A::operator delete(void *)"
