  /// \brief Determinize a TGBA
  ///
  /// The main algorithm works only with automata using Büchi acceptance
  /// (preferably transition-based).  If generalized Büchi is input, it
  /// will be automatically degeneralized first.
  ///
  /// The output will be a deterministic automaton using parity acceptance.
  ///
  /// This procedure is based on an algorithm by Roman Redziejowski
  /// (Fundamenta Informaticae 119, 3-4 (2012)).  Redziejowski's
  /// algorithm is similar to Piterman's improvement of Safra's
  /// algorithm, except it is presented on transition-based acceptance
  /// and use simpler notations.  We implement three additional
  /// optimizations (they can be individually disabled) based on
  ///
  ///   - knowledge about SCCs of the input automaton
  ///   - knowledge about simulation relations in the input automaton
  ///   - knowledge about stutter-invariance of the input automaton
  ///
  /// The last optimization is an idea described by Joachim Klein &
  /// Christel Baier (CIAA'07) and implemented in ltl2dstar.  In fact,
  /// ltl2dstar even has a finer version (letter-based stuttering)
  /// that is not implemented here.
  ///
  /// \param aut the automaton to determinize
  ///
  /// \param pretty_print whether to decorate states with names
  ///                     showing the paths they track (this only
  ///                     makes sense if the input has Büchi
  ///                     acceptance already, otherwise the input
  ///                     automaton will be degeneralized and the
  ///                     names will refer to the states in the
  ///                     degeneralized automaton).
  ///
  /// \param use_scc whether to simplify the construction based on
  ///                the SCCs in the input automaton.
  ///
  /// \param use_simulation whether to simplify the construction based
  ///                       on simulation relations between states in
  ///                       the original automaton.
  ///
  /// \param use_stutter whether to simplify the construction when the
  ///                    input automaton is known to be
  ///                    stutter-invariant.  (The stutter-invariant
  ///                    flag of the input automaton is used, so it
  ///                    might be worth to call
  ///                    spot::check_stutter_invariance() first if
  ///                    possible.)
  ///
  /// \param aborter abort the construction if the constructed
  ///                automaton would be too large.  Return nullptr
  ///                in this case.
