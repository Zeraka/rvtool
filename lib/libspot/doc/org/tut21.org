This example demonstrates how to iterate over an automaton in C++ and
Python.  This case uses automata stored entirely in memory as a graph:
states are numbered by integers, and transitions can be seen as tuples
of the form
$(\mathit{src},\mathit{dst},\mathit{cond},\mathit{accsets})$ where
$\mathit{src}$ and $\mathit{dst}$ are integers denoting the source and
destination states, $\mathit{cond}$ is a BDD representing the label
(a.k.a. guard), and $\mathit{accsets}$ is an object of type
=acc_cond::mark_t= encoding the membership to each acceptance sets
(=acc_cond::mark_t= is basically a bit vector).

The interface available for those graph-based automata allows random
access to any state of the graph, hence the code given bellow can do a
simple loop over all states of the automaton.  Spot also supports a
different kind of interface (not demonstrated here) to
[[file:tut50.org][iterate over automata that are constructed
on-the-fly]] and where such a loop would be impossible.

First let's create an example automaton in HOA format.  We use =-U= to
request unambiguous automata, as this allows us to demonstrate how
property bits are used.

* C++

We now write some C++ to load this automaton [[file:tut20.org][as we did before]], and in
=custom_print()= we print it out in a custom way by explicitly
iterating over its states and edges.

The only tricky part is to print the edge labels.  Since they are
BDDs, printing them directly would just show the identifiers of BDDs
involved.  Using =bdd_print_formula= and passing it the BDD dictionary
associated to the automaton is one way to print the edge labels.

Each automaton stores a vector the atomic propositions it uses.  You
can iterate on that vector using the =ap()= member function.  If you
want to convert an atomic proposition (represented by a =formula=)
into a BDD, use the =bdd_dict::varnum()= method to obtain the
corresponding BDD variable number, and then use for instance
=bdd_ithvar()= to convert this BDD variable number into an actual BDD.
