To help with keeping man pages in sync with the binaries, the man page
for PROGRAM is automatically generated from two sources:
  1. the --help output of bin/PROGRAM,
  2. the bin/man/PROGRAM.x file

The tool help2man is responsible for doing this conversion.

The PROGRAM.x file has [sections] headers to indicate sections.  The
rest of the file uses groff macros for man pages.  For detail on this
syntax, run "man groff_man".

Note that some of the standard sections will be forced to the top or
bottom of the manpage by help2man, the rest will appear as ordered in
PROGRAM.x.
