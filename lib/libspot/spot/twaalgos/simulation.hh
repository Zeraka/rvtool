  /// acceptance conditions than necessary, and running scc_filter()
  /// again afterwards will remove these superfluous conditions.

  /// The resulting automaton has a named property "simulated-states", that is a
  /// vector mapping each state of the input to a state of the output. Note that
  /// some input states may be mapped to -1, as a by-product of improved
  /// determinism. Typically, if the language of q1 is included in the language
