  /// safe to call this function.

  ///
  /// This function attempts to minimize the automaton \a aut_f using the
  /// algorithm implemented in the minimize_wdba() function, and presented
  /// by \cite dax.07.atva .
  ///
  /// Because it is hard to determine if an automaton corresponds
  /// to an obligation property, you should supply either the formula
  /// \a f expressed by the automaton \a aut_f, or \a aut_neg_f the negation
  /// of the automaton \a aut_neg_f.
  ///
  /// \param aut_f the automaton to minimize
  /// \param f the LTL formula represented by the automaton \a aut_f
  /// \param aut_neg_f an automaton representing the negation of \a aut_f
  /// \param reject_bigger Whether the minimal WDBA should be discarded if
  /// it has more states than the input.
  /// \return a new tgba if the automaton could be minimized, \a aut_f if
  /// the automaton cannot be minimized, 0 if we do not know if the
  /// minimization is correct because neither \a f nor \a aut_neg_f
  /// were supplied.
  ///
  /// The function proceeds as follows.  If the formula \a f or the
  /// automaton \a aut can easily be proved to represent an obligation
  /// formula, then the result of <code>minimize(aut)</code> is
  /// returned.  Otherwise, if \a aut_neg_f was not supplied but \a f
  /// was, \a aut_neg_f is built from the negation of \a f.  Then we
  /// check that <code>product(aut,!minimize(aut_f))</code> and <code>
  /// product(aut_neg_f,minize(aut))</code> are both empty.  If they
  /// are, the the minimization was sound.  (See the paper for full
  /// details.)
  ///
  /// If \a reject_bigger is set, this function will return the input
  /// automaton \a aut_f when the minimized WDBA has more states than
  /// the input automaton.  (More states are possible because of
  /// determinization step during minimize_wdba().)  Note that
  /// checking the size of the minimized WDBA occurs before ensuring
  /// that the minimized WDBA is correct.
  ///
  /// If an \a output_aborter is given, the determinization is aborted
  /// whenever it would produce an automaton that is too large.  In
  /// this case, aut_f is returned unchanged.
