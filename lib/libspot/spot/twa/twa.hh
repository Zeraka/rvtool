  /// twa_succ_iterator should normally not be created directly.
  /// Instead, they are created by passing a "source" state to
  /// twa::succ_iter(), which will create the instance of
  /// twa_succ_iterator to iterate over the successors of that state.
  ///
  /// This twa_succ_iterator class offers two types of services,
  /// offered by two groups of methods.  The methods first(), next(),
  /// and done() allow iteration over the set of outgoing edges.
  /// The methods cond(), acc(), dst(), allow inspecting the current
  /// edge.
  ///
  /// The twa_succ_iterator is usually subclassed so that iteration
  /// methods and accessor methods can be implemented differently in
  /// different automata.  In particular, this interface allows
  /// computing the set of successors on the fly if needed.
  ///
  /// The iterator can be used to iterate over all successors in a
  /// loop as follows:
  ///
  /// \code
  ///     for (i->first(); !i->done(); i->next())
  ///       {
  ///         // use i->cond(), i->acc(), i->dst()
  ///       }
  /// \endcode
  ///
  /// If there are n successors, there will be 1 call to first(), n
  /// calls to next() and n+1 calls to done(), so a total of 2(n+1)
  /// calls to virtual methods just to handle the iteration.  For this
  /// reason, we usually favor the following more efficient way of
  /// performing the same loop:
  ///
  /// \code
  ///     if (i->first())
  ///       do
  ///         {
  ///           // use i->cond(), i->acc(), i->dst()
  ///         }
  ///       while(i->next());

  /// n+1 calls to done().
