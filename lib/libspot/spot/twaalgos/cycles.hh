  /// \brief Enumerate elementary cycles in a SCC.
  ///
  /// This class implements a non-recursive version of the algorithm
  /// on page 170 of \cite loizou.82.is .
  /// (the additional preprocessings described later in that paper are
  /// not implemented).
  ///
  /// It should be noted that although the above paper does not
  /// consider multiple arcs and self-loops in its definitions, the
  /// algorithm they present works as expected in these cases.
  ///
  /// For our purpose an elementary cycle is a sequence of transitions
  /// that form a cycle and that visit a state at most once.  We may
  /// have two cycles that visit the same states in the same order if
  /// some pair of states are connected by several transitions.  Also
  /// A cycle may visit only one state if it is a self-loop.
  ///
  /// We represent a cycle by a sequence of succ_iterator objects
  /// positioned on the transition contributing to the cycle.  These
  /// succ_itertor are stored, along with their source state, in the
  /// dfs_ stack.  Only the last portion of this stack may form a
  /// cycle.
  ///
  /// Calling <code>run(n)</code> will enumerate all elementary cycles
  /// in SCC <code>n</code>.  Each time an SCC is found, the method
  /// cycle_found(s) is called with the initial state s of the cycle:
  /// the cycle is constituted from all the states that are on the \c
  /// dfs_ stack after \c s (including \c s).
  ///
  /// You should inherit from this class and redefine the
  /// cycle_found() method to perform any work you would like to do on
  /// the enumerated cycles.  If cycle_found() returns false, the
  /// run() method will terminate.  If it returns true, the run()
  /// method will search for the next elementary cycle and call
  /// cycle_found() again if it finds another cycle.
