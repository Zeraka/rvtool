  /// \brief A Testing Automaton.
  ///
  /// The Testing Automata (TA) were introduced by
  /// Henri Hansen, Wojciech Penczek and Antti Valmari
  /// in "Stuttering-insensitive automata for on-the-fly detection of livelock
  /// properties" In Proc. of FMICSÃ•02, vol. 66(2) of Electronic Notes in
  /// Theoretical Computer Science.Elsevier.
  ///
  /// While a TGBA automaton observes the value of the atomic propositions, the
  /// basic idea of TA is to detect the changes in these values; if a valuation
  ///  does not change between two consecutive valuations of an execution,
  /// the TA stay in the same state. A TA transition \c (s,k,d) is labeled by a
  /// "changeset" \c k: i.e. the set of atomic propositions that change between
  /// states \c s and \c d, if the changeset is empty then the transition is
  /// called stuttering transition.
  /// To detect execution that ends by stuttering in the same TA state, a
  /// new kind of acceptance states is introduced: "livelock-acceptance states"
  /// (in addition to the standard Buchi-acceptance states).
  ///
  /// Browsing such automaton can be achieved using two functions:
  /// \c get_initial_states_set or \c get_artificial_initial_state, and \c
  /// succ_iter. The former returns the initial state(s) while the latter lists
  /// the successor states of any state (filtred by "changeset").
  ///
  /// Note that although this is a transition-based automata,
  /// we never represent transitions!  Transition informations are
  /// obtained by querying the iterator over the successors of
  /// a state.
