Preparations:
=============

Install libxml2 sources from libxml.org. The versions we have used for ac++
are 2.6.17, 2.7.2, and 2.9.2. Configure the sources with...

./configure --prefix=<some target dir> --disable-shared --with-minimum --with-xpath --with-output --with-sax1 --with-tree

For cross compiling a windows version on Linux you might add...

--host=i586-mingw32msvc
(or similar)

Then run "make" and "make install". To make sure that the AspectC++
Makefile find the right libxml2-config command put the bin directory
from <some target dir> in your command search path.

Build the Puma library with your desired TARGET, e.g. "make
TARGET=linux-release".


Build AspectC++:
================

Set the PUMA environment variable to PUMA root directory (if Puma is
not located in ../Puma).

Execute "make" with the right TARGET setting from your Puma build,
e.g. "make TARGET=linux-release".

To weave and compile, use "make".

To run the test programs, use "make testclean testall".
You need to set the environment variable PUMA_CONFIG to your local puma.cfg, eg. ../Puma/gen-release/puma.cfg

The examples can be tested with "make exampleclean examplerun".
