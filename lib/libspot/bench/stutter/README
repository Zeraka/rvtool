This benchmark measures the performance of different algorithms to
check if a property is stutter-invariant.  When the benchmark is run
on formulas, the translation time is not included in the measured
time.

To reproduce the benchmark run

  % ./stutter_bench.sh -j8

(Adjust -j8 to the number of cores you have.)

This should create three files:

  - bench_formulas.csv
      running stutter checks on LTL formulas, but without including
      LTL translation time.
  - bench_randgraph.csv
      unning stutter checks on deterministic TGBA, without including
      complementation time.
  - ltl-user-bench.csv
      running stutter checks on LTL formulas, from the user point
      of view, i.e., timing the whole "ltlfilt" run.
