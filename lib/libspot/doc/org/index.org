Spot is a C++14 library for LTL, ω-automata manipulation and model
checking.  It has the following notable features:

- Support for [[file:concepts.org::#ltl][LTL]] (several syntaxes supported) and
  [[file:concepts.org::#psl][a subset of the linear fragment of PSL]].
- Support for ω-automata with [[file:concepts.org::#acceptance-condition][arbitrary acceptance condition]].
- Support for [[file:concepts.org::#trans-acc][transition-based acceptance]] (state-based acceptance is
  supported by a reduction to transition-based acceptance).
- The automaton parser can read a stream of automata written in any of
  four syntaxes ([[file:hoa.org][HOA]], [[http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/never.html][never claims]], [[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/lbtt/doc/html/Format-for-automata.html][LBTT]], [[http://www.ltl2dstar.de/docs/ltl2dstar.html][DSTAR]]).
- Several algorithms for formula manipulation including: simplifying
  formulas, testing implication or equivalence, [[https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/ipynb/stutter-inv.html][testing
  stutter-invariance]], removing some operators by rewriting,
  translation to automata, testing membership to the [[file:hierarchy.org][temporal
  hierarchy of Manna & Pnueli]]...
- Several algorithms for automata manipulation including: product,
  emptiness checks, simulation-based reductions, minimization of
  weak-DBA, removal of useless SCCs, acceptance-condition
  transformations, determinization, [[file:satmin.org][SAT-based minimization of
  deterministic automata]], etc.
- In addition to the C++ interface, most of its algorithms are usable
  via [[file:tools.org][command-line tools]], and via [[file:tut.org][Python bindings]].
- One command-line tool, called [[file:ltlcross.org][=ltlcross=]], is a rewrite of [[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/lbtt/][LBTT]], but
  with support for PSL and automata with arbitrary acceptance
  conditions.  It can be used to test tools that translate LTL into
  ω-automata, or benchmark them.  A similar tool, [[file:autcross.org][=autcross=]], checks
  tools that transform automata.

* Try Spot On-line

- [[https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/app/][Our on-line translator]] provides a convenient way to translate LTL or
  PSL formulas into automata, or to study/compare formulas.
- [[http://spot-sandbox.lrde.epita.fr/][spot-sandbox]] is a Jupyter notebook with a complete installation of
  Spot that allows you to try the [[file:tools.org][command-line tools]] (using a shell
  interface) as well as the Python bindings (in an IPython notebook).

* License

Spot is distributed under a [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html][GNU GPL v3 license]].

One consequence is that any work based on Spot is covered by that
license as well.  For instance if you distribute a tool that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Linking_and_derived_works][links
with]] Spot, you should distribute the source code of that tool as well.
